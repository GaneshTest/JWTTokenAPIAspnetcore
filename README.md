# Repository pattern
Repository is a generic implementation of the Repository pattern in C#. It provides a repository base class Repository<T> that exposes functions to store/retrieve data, and an object context base class ObjectContext<T> that enables manipulation of data once it's retrieved. It also exposes an Items property that returns an IQueryable<T> which can be used to perform LINQ queries on the repository.
